# Project-What-To-Do
Our first major class project

## User Story

A visitor to Raleigh, or a resident whoâ€™s about to have an outdoorsy visitor, wants to find places to hike, bike, or camp in the area. At a glance on the homepage they can see the current weather and (provided it isn't inclemant) they can choose hiking, biking or camping. Clicking these links takes them to a new page where they can select their city - with a default of Raleigh, but maybe they want Durham or Chapel Hill or anywhere else. They can choose how many results they recieve and how far away they are willing to travel. The page will display some options of trails or campsites. The user can then utilize the favorite heart to add their favorite to the favorite page and save for later! (Note: favorites are saved in local storage so only accessible from that computer.)

## Future Roadmap

The REI project that we used as a data source has an API to let you store favorites by email address - then they would be accessible from any computer. <br>

Add other things to do such as concerts (in outdoor venues like Walnut Creek or the Red Hat Amphitheater!) and restaurants to make a more complete site for visitors.
